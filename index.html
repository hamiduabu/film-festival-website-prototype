            <p>Several film festival submission portal websites exist to streamline filmmakers' entries into multiple
              festivals. They provide databases of festival calls for entry and offer filmmakers a convenient "describe
              once, submit many" service.</p>
            <p>In addition to screenings all weekend at two historic venues, we also hold filmmaker receptions,
              after-parties, panel discussions, Q&As and workshops. Most of the filmmakers attend and our audience loves
              to meet them! We provide two nights lodging at a local B&B and go out of our way to keep you well-fed.</p>

            <p>The core tradition of film festivals is competition, that is, the consideration of films with the
              intention
              of judging which are most deserving of various forms of recognition. In contrast to those films, some
              festivals may screen (i.e., project onto a movie screen before an audience) some films without treating
              them
              as part of the competition; the films are said to be "screened out..." (or "outside...") "of competition".

              Phase 3 with next month's sequel, Spider-Man: Far From Home. The web-slinger adventure aims to end 2019 on
              a strong note for the brand, following the block-busting success of both Endgame and March's Captain

          <p>A feisty septuagenarian teams with a fearless wilderness ranger to do battle with a vicious band
            of beasts and villains in this computer-animated adventure scripted by Pixar veteran Bob Peterson
            and co-directed by Peterson and Monsters, Inc. director Peter Docter. Carl Fredricksen is a
            78-year-old balloon salesman. His entire life, Carl has longed to wander the wilds of South
            America. Then, one day, the irascible senior citizen shocks his neighbors by tying thousands of
            balloons to his home and finally taking flight. But Carl isn't alone on his once-in-a-lifetime
            journey, because stowed away on his front porch is an excitable eight-year-old wilderness explorer
            named Russell. Later, as the house touches down on the world's second largest continent, Carl and
            his unlikely traveling companion step outside to discover that not only is their new front lawn
            considerably larger, but that the predators therein are much more ferocious than anything they
            ever faced back home.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="modal-body">
          <p>One of the most popular movie musicals of all time, The Sound of Music is based on the true story of the
            Trapp Family Singers. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, a young nun in an Austrian convent who regularly misses
            her morning prayers because she enjoys going to the hills to sing the title song. Deciding that Maria needs
            to learn something about the real world before she can take her vows, the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood) sends
            her off to be governess for the children of the widowed Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). Arriving at
            the Trapp home, Maria discovers that her new boss is cold and aloof, and his seven children virtual
            automatons-at least, whenever the Captain is around. Otherwise, the kids are holy terrors, as evidenced by
            the fact that Maria is the latest in a long line of governesses. But Maria soon ingratiates herself with the
            children, especially oldest daughter Liesl (Charmian Carr), who is in love with teenaged messenger boy Rolf.
            As Maria herself begins to fall in love with the Captain, she rushes back to the Abbey so as not to
            complicate his impending marriage to a glamorous baroness (Eleanor Parker). But the children insist that
            Maria return, the Baroness steps out of the picture, and Maria and the Captain confirm their love in the
            song "Something Good." Unhappily, they return home from their honeymoon shortly after the Nazis march into
            Austria. Already, swastikas have been hung on the Von Trapp ancestral home, and Liesl's boyfriend Rolf has
            been indoctrinated in the "glories" of the Third Reich. The biggest blow occurs when Von Trapp is called
            back to active duty in the service of the Fuhrer. The Captain wants nothing to do with Nazism, and he begins
            making plans to take himself and his family out of Austria.</p>

          <p>Four police officers attempt to put their faith in God after a sudden and unexpected tragedy transforms
            their lives forever. Produced by Sherwood Pictures, the Christian production company behind such popular
            films as Fireproof and Facing the Giants, Courageous follows dedicated cops Adam Mitchell and Nathan Hayes
            as they work with their partners to keep the streets safe. But when these devoted peacekeepers face the
            challenge of fatherhood, both their faith and devotion to family are put to the ultimate test. In the
            aftermath of a devastating calamity, they are faced with a difficult choice that will ultimately come to
            define their lives. Fortunately, a wise mentor appears to help them understand that man's ambition and God's
            will aren't always in perfect harmony.</p>

          <p>Taken in by a well-to-do family and offered a second chance at life, a homeless teen grows to become the
            star athlete projected to be the first pick at the NFL draft in this sports-themed comedy drama inspired by
            author Michael Lewis' best-seller The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. Michael Oher was living on the
            streets when he was welcomed into the home of a conservative suburban family, but over time he matured into
            a talented athlete. As the NFL draft approaches, fans and sports radio personalities alike speculate that
            Oher will be the hottest pick of the year. Sandra Bullock stars in a film written and directed by John Lee
            Hancock (The Rookie, The Alamo).</p>

          <p>Toy Story was the first feature-length film animated entirely by computer. If this seems to be a sterile,
            mechanical means of moviemaking, be assured that the film is as chock-full of heart and warmth as any Disney
            cartoon feature. The star of the proceedings is Woody, a pull-string cowboy toy belonging to a wide-eyed
            youngster named Andy. Whenever Andy's out of the room, Woody revels in his status as the boy's number one
            toy. His supremacy is challenged by a high-tech, space-ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who,
            unlike Woody and his pals, believes that he is real and not merely a plaything. The rivalry between Woody
            and Buzz hilariously intensifies during the first half of the film, but when the well-being of Andy's toys
            is threatened by a nasty next-door neighbor kid named Sid -- whose idea of fun is feeding stuffed dolls to
            his snarling dog and reconstructing his own toys into hideous mutants -- Woody and Buzz join forces to save
            the day. Superb though the computer animation may be, what really heightens Toy Story are the voice-over
            performances by such celebrities as Tom Hanks (as Woody), Tim Allen (as Buzz), and Don Rickles (as an
            appropriately acerbic Mr. Potato Head). Director John Lasseter earned a special achievement Academy Award,
            while Randy Newman landed an Oscar nomination for his evocative musical score.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="modal-body">
          <p>Long resistant to film adaptations of her Mary Poppins books, P.L. Travers finally succumbed to the
            entreaties of Walt Disney, and the result is often considered the finest of Disney's personally supervised
            films. The Travers stories are bundled together to tell the story of the Edwardian-era British Banks family:
            the banker father (David Tomlinson), suffragette mother (Glynis Johns), and the two "impossible" children
            (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber). The kids get the attention of their all-business father by bedevilling
            every new nanny in the Banks household. Whem Mr. Banks advertises conventionally for another nanny, the kids
            compose their own ad, asking for someone with a little kindness and imagination. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews
            in her screen debut) answers the children's ad by arriving at the Banks home from the skies, parachuting
            downward with her umbrella. She immediately endears herself to the children. The next day they meet Mary's
            old chum Bert (Dick Van Dyke), currently employed as a sidewalk artist. Mary, Bert, and the children hop
            into one of Bert's chalk drawings and learn the nonsense song "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" in a
            cartoon countryside. Later, they pay a visit to Bert's Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so hard that he
            floats to the ceiling. Mr. Banks is pleased that his children are behaving better, but he's not happy with
            their fantastic stories. To show the children what the real world is like, he takes them to his bank. A
            series of disasters follow which result in his being fired from his job. Mary Poppins' role in all this
            leads to some moments when it is possible to fear that all her good work will be undone, but like the
            magical being she is, all her "mistakes" lead to a happy result by the end of the film.</p>

          <p>A heroic fireman locked in a failing marriage accepts his father's challenge to take part in a 40-day
            experiment designed to teach both husband and wife the true meaning of commitment in this faith-based
            marriage drama starring Kirk Cameron and Erin Bethea. When he's battling blazes, Capt. Caleb Holt (Cameron)
            adheres to the old firefighter's adage about never leaving your partner behind; back at home, it's an
            altogether different story. Caleb and his wife Catherine (Bethea) have been married for seven years, but
            lately arguments over career, housework, finances, and outside interests have driven the once-happy couple
            hopelessly apart. Just as Caleb and Catherine prepare to officially dissolve their marriage, Caleb's father
            John (Harris Malcolm) presents his son with a most unusual challenge: commit to a 40-day experiment called
            "The Love Dare," and take one last shot at saving his marriage. While at first Caleb agrees to take a chance
            on "The Love Dare," the discovery that it's closely tied in with his parent's newfound faith causes him to
            momentarily reconsider. Still, Caleb carries on with the experiment despite being constantly rejected by his
            skeptical, embittered wife. When Caleb asks his father how he can be expected to love someone who refuses to
            give him a fair chance, John tells his son that this is precisely the same love that God shows for
            humankind. Now, with a little help from above, the man who makes headlines for saving lives will fight to be
            a hero to the one person who matters most -- his wife.</p>

          <p>A high school football coach finds himself fighting for stakes much higher than the State Championship in
            this drama based on actual events. In 1971, a court order forces three high schools in Alexandria, Virginia
            (two white, one African-American), to integrate their student bodies and faculties for the first time. As a
            result, Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), longtime head coach of the T.C. Williams High School football team,
            is asked to step down, and Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is appointed to replace him as the school's
            first black faculty member. The new coach is hardly welcomed with open arms, either by the school's staff or
            the students, and the newly integrated team is full of players (both black and white) who have little trust
            or respect for one another. But Boone is determined to put a winning team on the field -- it's how he
            approaches the game, and his future depends on it. Against long odds, Boone helps his team overcome distrust
            and misunderstanding of their coach (and each other) as they become a gridiron force to be reckoned with.
            Remember the Titans also features Nicole Ari Parker, Kate Bosworth, and Jerry Brandt, and was produced by
            action-film kingpin Jerry Bruckheimer.</p>

        <section class="modal-body">
          <p>One of the most popular Disney animated musicals, The Lion King presents the story of a lion cub's journey
            to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny. Simba (voiced first by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then by
            Matthew Broderick) begins life as an honored prince, the son of the powerful King Mufasa (voiced by James
            Earl Jones). The cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons),
            murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically
            bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and Timon the meerkat (voiced by Nathan Lane),
            he and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his
            father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne. Borrowing elements
            from Hamlet, classical mythology, and African folk tales, The Lion King tells its mythic coming-of-age tale
            with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by Elton John
            and Tim Rice, and a score by Hans Zimmer. Embraced by children and adults alike, the film also spawned hit
            songs ("Can You Feel the Love Tonight," "The Circle of Life") and a hit Broadway musical. In late 2002, The
            Lion King was re-released in the large-screen IMAX format.</p>

          <p>At one time the longest-running Broadway musical, My Fair Lady was adapted by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick
            Loewe from the George Bernard Shaw comedy Pygmalion. Outside Covent Garden on a rainy evening in 1912,
            dishevelled cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) meets linguistic expert Henry Higgins (Rex
            Harrison). After delivering a musical tirade against "verbal class distinction," Higgins tells his companion
            Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde-White) that, within six months, he could transform Eliza into a proper lady,
            simply by teaching her proper English. The next morning, face and hands freshly scrubbed, Eliza presents
            herself on Higgins' doorstep, offering to pay him to teach her to be a lady. "It's almost irresistable,"
            clucks Higgins. "She's so deliciously low. So horribly dirty." He turns his mission into a sporting
            proposition, making a bet with Pickering that he can accomplish his six-month miracle to turn Eliza into a
            lady. This is one of the all-time great movie musicals, featuring classic songs and the legendary
            performances of Harrison, repeating his stage role after Cary Grant wisely turned down the movie job, and
            Stanley Holloway as Eliza's dustman father. Julie Andrews originated the role of Eliza on Broadway but
            producer Jack Warner felt that Andrews, at the time unknown beyond Broadway, wasn't bankable; Hepburn's
            singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon, who also dubbed Natalie Wood in West Side Story (1961). Andrews instead
            made Mary Poppins, for which she was given the Best Actress Oscar, beating out Hepburn. The movie, however,
            won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Harrison, and five other Oscars, and it remains one of the
            all-time best movie musicals.</p>

          <p>A failing high-school football coach finds that in order to succeed he must convince his team that there's
            more to sports than fame and glory in an inspirational tale of courage on the gridiron and the power of
            God's word. Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick) has been coaching the Shiloh Eagles for six years, and he has yet
            to realize his dream of a winning season. When the team's star player transfers schools, the first three
            games of the new season show no promise for improvement, troubles at home begin to take their toll, and a
            plot among the player's fathers to have him fired finds his future in football looking bleak, Coach Taylor
            is faced with the prospect of either cutting his losses and admitting defeat or turning his life over to God
            in an attempt to test the true power of faith. With his job on the line and nothing left to lose, Coach
            Taylor convinces his determined team of underdogs that there's nothing they can't accomplish with a little
            faith -- including the miracle of a winning season when all hope seems lost.</p>

          <p>The rousing, true-life story of a single dad who went from living on the streets to owning his own
            brokerage firm is brought to the big screen by superstar Will Smith, appearing for the first time opposite
            his real-life son Jaden Smith. Set in early-'80s San Francisco, the film charts the hard times and eventual
            comeback of Chris Gardner, a suddenly single salesman who has custody of his son, but finds that providing
            for the two of them is a challenge in the increasingly unstable economic climate. He struggles to work his
            way from unpaid intern at Dean Witter to something more substantial, even as life continues to offer him
            setbacks. Making his Hollywood debut, Italian director Gabriele Muccino was championed by Will Smith for the
            project.</p>
